    <h1>AI introduction</h1>
    <p>According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy, it is “The science and engineering of making
        intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.

        Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think
        intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think.

        AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to
        solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and
        systems.</p>
